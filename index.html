          <h2>Meet Your Doula</h2>
          <p>
          I’m a young, well‑read, and deeply devoted doula—here to hold steady space as you cross the threshold into parenthood. My care is both evidence‑informed and heart‑led: rooted in research, guided by intuition, and grounded in the belief that you deserve to feel safe, seen, and supported in every season of this journey. I’m here to help you soften into trust, advocate for your choices, and move through pregnancy, birth, and postpartum with more clarity, calm, and connection.
